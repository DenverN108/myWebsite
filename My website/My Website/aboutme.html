           <p> So I work a 7-4 job and have been inspired and motivated by watching Anime to do the best I can.<br>
            It has become my foundation as to the person I am today, by not giving up and always trusting my friends to have my back<br>
            I watch alot of Anime, I don't really know what's "normal TV" anymore.<br>
            My favorite of all time is the big 5:</p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Dragonballz</li>
                <li>Naruto</li>
                <li>Bleach</li>
                <li>Fairy Tail</li>
                <li>OnePiece</li>
            </ol>
           <p> Watching Dragonballz has taught me that there is always ways of improving yourself.<br>
            Watching Naruto has taught me to never give up!!!<br>
            Watching Bleach has taught me that only a few people that do you wrong will get to see your dark side.<br>
            Watching Fairy Tail has taught me that there is power in friendship.<br>
            Watching OnePiece has taught me to accept everyone for who they are and to trust in your team.<br>
            Over the past couple of years I have taken a liking to sports anime, that includes Haikyuu and Kuroko's basketball to name a few.</p>
