### Description and what the project does

This is a website I built as part of my learning web development.This website is about Anime that are my favorites and give a brief description of a few of them.

On this website you will see a function that allows you to hide and restore all images on the page. There is also an animation function that will change the background color as well as a slide function for all text on the page. You will then see a dropdown menu that will take you to the page that you want. There is also a 'Save For Later' feature that willl allow the user to save the picture they like to a seperate page as well as to like the picture. At the end of the **Home** page you will have resources that will take you to websites that will allow you to watch Anime.
